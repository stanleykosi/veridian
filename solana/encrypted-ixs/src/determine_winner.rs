// This module contains the confidential logic for determining the winner of a poker hand at showdown.
// The entire process is executed securely within the Arcium MPC environment to ensure that player
// hands are compared without being revealed publicly.
//
// Note: The actual implementation is located in the `circuits` module in `lib.rs`, which is the
// entry point for Arcis instruction compilation. This file serves to keep the project
// structure organized.
