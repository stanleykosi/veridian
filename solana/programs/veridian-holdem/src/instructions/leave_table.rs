/**
 * @description
 * This file contains the logic for the `leave_table` instruction, allowing a player
 * to exit the game and withdraw their remaining chip stack from the escrow.
 *
 * @key_features
 * - Validates that the game is in a non-active state (e.g., between hands).
 * - Transfers the player's chip balance from the escrow PDA back to their wallet.
 * - Resets the player's slot in the `GameState` to allow a new player to join.
 * - Handles closing game accounts if the last player leaves, refunding rent.
 *
 * @dependencies
 * - crate::state: Defines the `GameState` and `TableConfig`.
 * - crate::error: Defines custom error codes.
 * - anchor_lang & anchor_spl: For Solana and SPL Token operations.
